/*
 * Position of rightmost set bit
 * 
 * Write a one-line function to return the position of the first 1 from right to left, in the binary representation of an Integer. 

Examples:

Input: n = 18
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary Representation of 18 is 010010, hence position of first set bit from right is 2.

Input:  n = 19
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary Representation of 19 is 010011, hence position of first set bit from right is 1.
